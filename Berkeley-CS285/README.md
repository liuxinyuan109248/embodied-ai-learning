# UC Berkeley CS285: Deep Reinforcement Learning

### Description
Led by Sergey Levine, this is the gold standard course for Deep RL. It covers the transition from basic supervised learning to complex decision-making, including policy gradients, Q-learning, and model-based RL.

### Key Topics
* Policy Gradients & Actor-Critic
* Off-Policy Deep RL (DQN, SAC)
* Offline Reinforcement Learning
* Meta-Learning and Transfer Learning
